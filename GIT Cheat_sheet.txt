git add/rm file_name (to update what will be commited)
git restore file_name (to discard changes in working repo)

git remote remove origin (to remove the origin from remote)

 git checkout --track origin/master (to switch from one branch to another) helps in switching

git checkout -b new_branch_name (same switching work)
git switch branch_name (switching)

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git (both used to remove and readding with the github repo) 

git fetch origin master (if resert remote repository or newly added after removing then fetching is essential to work on further)

if fetch not works then:

git rebase origin/master (git rebasing will done rest of the work)

git push origin master (then try for push again )

git pull --rebase origin master (This command fetches changes from the remote "master" branch, rebases your local changes, and pushes them back to the remote.)
